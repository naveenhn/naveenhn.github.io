Born Bengalurean (aka Bangalorean), a technology enthusiast, software developer, food junkie and a liking to travel. To support all these, I currently work as a Technology Architect in one of the large IT company in India.

With 10+ years experience in Java, JEE and web related technologies (dabbled with Salesforce.com also), it has enabled me to take a shot at many languages, frameworks, tools and their best practices. Recently, I have been exploring lot of new things in the world of Big Data like Hadoop, Spark, Scala etc. Here's my attempt to keep a log of things so it helps me and others (may) as well.  

Lot of people around me try their culinary skills these days and I would like to capture that as well or at least share them here.

My interests are short lived, so is my blog writing interest. I started writing blog with blogger, then moved it to [wordpress](https://codecafe.wordpress.com/) all of which ended after a couple of blogs. Somehow, I could not keep up the zeal and promptness in writing blogs. Until, a new kid who joined our team recently introduced me to the world of static blogs. I tried few of them like Jekyll and Octopress etc. and finally zeroed on Jekyll after knowing that GitHub pages is built using it and GitHub supports it **free of cost**. Here I am taking a shot at it again to write about technology, food, travel and everything!
