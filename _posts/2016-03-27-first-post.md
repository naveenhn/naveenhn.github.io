My first post is about Jekyll itself. I will not go about installation and other nuances, you will find a ton of information, just Google it. However I would recommend the following sites a must for anyone starting with Jekyll.

* [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages)
* [Getting Started with Jekyll (plus a Free Bootstrap 3 Starter Theme)](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-jekyll-plus-a-free-bootstrap-3-starter-theme)
* [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/)
* [Jekyll Tips](http://jekyll.tips/)


When I started out, I wanted to keep it simple, light but a little different from the vanilla version offered out of the box. I wanted use a light weight CSS framework which was responsive but not [BootStrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). Why? I just wanted to break the stereotype, there were a ton of sites offering a bootstrap version. So my options were a couple like [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), [Pure.css](http://purecss.io/). I went with [Pure.css](http://purecss.io/) and it looked decent. I am still adding plugins like jekyll-paginate, jekyll-gist and tinkering the look and feel using [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) etc. May be in future, I may try Skeleton or Bootstrap itself.

Please feel free to check out the changes I did in [github](https://github.com/naveenhn/naveenhn.github.io)
