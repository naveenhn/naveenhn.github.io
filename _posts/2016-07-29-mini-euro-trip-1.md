The trip was planned with short notice as my wife had her training planned for couple of weeks in Erlangen, Germany. I just joined her for a week and weekends were planned as Prague and Paris.

 Though I continued to use Unix/Linux at work, it was only during 2006 - 2008 I thought of using Linux as my desktop OS. It was during this period that Ubuntu, Fedora Core (now just Fedora), SUSE and Arch were making a buzz. I tried Ubuntu, but I always felt at home with Fedora due to my familiarity with Red Hat. Though I have been using both of these distros often, Fedora has been my primary desktop OS for sometime now. [Gnome 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME#GNOME_2) (now [MATE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATE_%28software%29)) DE with [Compiz](http://www.compiz.org/)  compositing window manager would enable you to have a fancy Desktop in the past. As [Gnome-3](https://www.gnome.org/gnome-3/) became mainstream for many distros and Ubuntu moved towards [Unity](https://unity.ubuntu.com/), I chose Fedora as it was one of the first distros to use the latest Gnome-3 version. Gnome with its extensions, themes (GTK+, Icon) will enable you to have a near perfect desktop you always wanted. Here is my work horse
